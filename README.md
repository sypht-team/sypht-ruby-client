# Sypht Ruby Client
This repository is a Ruby reference client implementation for working with the Sypht API at https://api.sypht.com.

## About Sypht
[Sypht](https://sypht.com) is a SaaS [API]((https://docs.sypht.com/)) which extracts key fields from documents. For 
example, you can upload an image or pdf of a bill or invoice and extract the amount due, due date, invoice number 
and biller information. 

## Getting started
To get started you'll need API credentials, i.e. a `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>`, which can be obtained by registering
for an [account](https://www.sypht.com/signup/developer)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sypht-ruby-client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sypht-ruby-client
        
## Usage
